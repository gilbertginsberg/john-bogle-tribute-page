          <figcaption>John Clifton "Jack" Bogle created the first passive index
            mutual fund open to the public, the Vanguard 500, and with it
            revolutionized investing. If there were a Mt. Rushmore for investment
            giants, Bogle's face would tower over us, alongside the likes of Warren
            Buffett and Benjamin Graham. His crusade for simplicity, common sense,
            and low fees in the financial industry is heralded by an army of
            devoted foot soldiers, known as the <a href="https://www.bogleheads.org/"

          <blockquote>
            <p>“There are a few investment managers, of course, who are very good
              – though in the short run, it’s difficult to determine whether a great
              record is due to luck or talent. Most advisors, however, are far better
              at generating high fees than they are at generating high returns.
              In truth, their core competence is salesmanship. Rather than listen
              to their siren songs, investors – large and small – should instead
              read Jack Bogle’s The Little Book of Common Sense Investing.” .</p>
